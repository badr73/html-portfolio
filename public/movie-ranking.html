<hr />
<h3>Our God Is One</h3>
<p>This documentry movie give clear proofs that our God exists, unique not three,
     has no son, nor a father. The proofs given are of different kind and

<h3>Jesus is a human and a messanger of God</h3>
<p>
    This historical movie emphsasis the fact that Jesus, 
    the son of Marry, is a human being like us, but His birth 
    was miraculous i.e. He was born without a father juste like Adam 
    who was created without a father nor a mother.

    Then the movie deal with the real role of Jesus. He was a Messanger
    of God to teach people the truth, how to worship God and to 
    be a good person. But he never say I am a God nor a son of God, 
    Indeed the trinity is an inovation of the church, 
    Indeed to Allah is our return, and he will judge between
     us concerning that in which we used to differ.
